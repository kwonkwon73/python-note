I forgot to upload a review note yesterday :(
I only upload a facebook content of my study.

####Todo List
yesterday, I studied binary-search algorithm with [<그림으로 이해하는 알고리즘>][1]. but there are some part of code that I didn't understand. (understand means I can explain it.) so today I will have supplementary lessons for these.
- meaning of `return`, `:`, `//`
- and why use `return mid` in first `if` statement.
: I think `mid` is just a number of list, not same as a elements' value. for example `mid = (low+high) // 2` has a only number to point the element of the list, then`guess = list[mid]` is a element, the real value we want.
