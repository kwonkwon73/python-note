I took this book 'Learn Python the Hard Way' since 2days ago. (17.12.06.Wed)
Because my knowledge about Python has many many holes.
So I decided to learn this language on the right way.

1. ex00 - The Setup
First step is how to set up a Python development environment on my computer.
In the tutorial the author said,
*"A programmer may try get you install Python 3 and learn that. Say, "When all the Python code on your computer is Python 3, then I'll try to learn it." That should keep him or her busy for about 10 years."*
But after the book was published(2015) and now(2017), Python.org will be end of support for Python 2.7.(Python2.7 will not be maintained past 2020.)
I already use Python 3.6 with atom, so I just keep using them.

2. ex01 - A Good First Program
I learned how to use a `print()` that is one of built in functions.
If I want to use a `"`(double-quote) character in a sentence wrapped same character `""`, I can use a `\`(backslash) to escape character. Like this.
`print("She said, \"Hello, World!\"")`

3. ex02 - Comments and Pound Characters
I can write comments by putting the ```#``` character in Python Code.
*```#This sentence will not be printed.```* A ```#``` character is called a "pound", "hash", "octothorpe", or any number of names.

4. ex03 - Numbers and Math
I learned how to read some math characters in English.
- `*` : asterisk
- `<=` : less-than-equal
- `>=` : greater-than-equal

5. ex04 - Variables and Names
I can use Variables with `float()`, `int()` for setting values.
and I can explain the meaning of `=`(operator) character.
It is not same as math, rather than It means assigning a value to a variable.

//test
